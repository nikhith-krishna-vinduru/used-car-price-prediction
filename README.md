**Forecasting the Value of Pre-Owned Vehicles** 🚗


This project predicts the selling price of used vehicles using regression-based machine learning models. It was developed as part of an academic capstone to apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling on real-world car data.

🎯 **Objective**


The goal is to help individuals or dealerships predict the fair value of a used car based on attributes like brand, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and year.


📈 **Outcome**


Achieved 85% R² score using XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters


Created Power BI dashboards to visualize key market trends by car make, fuel type, and depreciation over time
