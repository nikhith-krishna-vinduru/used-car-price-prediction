# 🚗 Forecasting the Value of Pre-Owned Vehicles


This machine learning project predicts the resale price of pre-owned cars based on historical data, using advanced regression models and feature engineering techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview


The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of used cars using features such as brand, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. The project includes data cleaning, EDA, model building, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement


Used car buyers and sellers often face challenges in evaluating the fair value of vehicles. Our model provides a data-driven solution to predict realistic car prices, helping individuals and dealerships make better decisions.
